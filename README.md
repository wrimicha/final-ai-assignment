In todayâ€™s world, there is a huge amount of data that is available in a variety of sectors including the banking industry. With the help of machine learning tools, we are better able to understand this data such that we are able to make faster, more informed, and relevant decisions based on a customer base. In this project, I examine the use of pycaret in order to generate a list of models which are shown to perform the best based on the data. From there additional comparison between best models and other models are compared, and results are tested through the use of the plot model function to perform exploratory data anaysis. Through the use of statistical measures, we are able to determine the best results and examin the success of generated models through pycaret. Our results showed amoung all models tested after further analysis and tuning that the best results were achieved by the lightgbm with a mean AUC of 0.9491 or 94.91% and an accuracy of 0.9186 or 91.86%
